# About

The repository is used to track data in the SEDOS project for documentation and discussion purposes.

The data should be transformed into the [oedatamodel-parameter](https://sedos-project.github.io/.
github/data_requirements/input_data/#datamodel) and uploaded into the SEDOS data pipeline, following these 
[instructions](https://sedos-project.github.io/.github/how_to_contribute_data/).

Directories follow the work package (AP) structure in the project. Each work package covers a specific energy sector:

AP4 - Electricity
AP5 - PtX 
AP6 - Heat
AP7 - Industry
AP8 - Mobility
