The cost curves for natural gas and LNG from Molnar (2022) 10.1007/978-3-030-86884-0_2 were adapted and the average transportation distance based on the countries where Germany imports the majority from was determined (1000km and 6000km respectively). From that the relative cost differences for these distances was determined leading to a cost factor of 2.93:1 with respect to LNG. Therefore, the costs determined for pipeline import was multiplied by the factor 2.93 to yield the variable costs, monetary conversion from €2022 to €2021.'}","{'cost_var_e': '5molnarEconomicsGasTransportation2022,5TYNDP2022Scenario'}",""
